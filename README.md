# Smart Air Quality and Pollution Alert System
A simulation-based IoT project that models air pollution levels and uploads real-time data to the ThingSpeak cloud using MATLAB. The system generates realistic PM2.5, PM10, and CO₂ values, calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI), predicts future AQI trends, and triggers automated alerts when pollution exceeds safe thresholds.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Air pollution is increasing worldwide, making real-time monitoring extremely important for public health and environmental safety.  
This project demonstrates how IoT, cloud platforms, and MATLAB-based analytics can be combined to build a **Smart Air Quality Monitoring System**.

The system simulates sensor behavior using a dynamic random-walk model and performs:

- Real-time pollution simulation  
- AQI computation using EPA standards  
- Predictive AQI estimation  
- Pollution alert generation  
- Cloud upload to ThingSpeak for visualization  

The project showcases how IoT-based monitoring solutions can help in smart cities, health monitoring, and environmental protection.

## 📊 ThingSpeak Channel Fields
| Field | Parameter           |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1     | PM2.5 (µg/m³)        |
| 2     | PM10 (µg/m³)         |
| 3     | CO₂ (ppm)            |
| 4     | AQI                  |
| 5     | Alert Status (0/1)   |
| 6     | Predicted AQI        |
| 7     | Duplicate AQI value  |

## 📡 How It Works
1. MATLAB script simulates pollution values.
2. AQI is computed using US EPA standards.
3. Prediction logic estimates next AQI value.
4. Alerts are triggered based on AQI threshold.
5. Data uploads to ThingSpeak every 15 seconds.
6. ThingSpeak dashboard displays graphs in real time.
